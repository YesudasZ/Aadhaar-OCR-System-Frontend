# Aadhaar OCR System

This is a React-based frontend for an Aadhaar Card Optical Character Recognition (OCR) system. It allows users to upload the front and back images of their Aadhaar card, processes these images via an OCR API, and extracts key details such as name, Aadhaar number, date of birth, gender, and address.

## Features
- **Image Upload**: Users can upload front and back images of their Aadhaar card.
- **File Validation**: Only PNG, JPEG, JPG, and WEBP image formats are allowed, with a file size limit of 5MB.
- **Image Preview**: The uploaded images are previewed before being processed.
- **Aadhaar Data Extraction**: Extracted Aadhaar data such as name, Aadhaar number, and address is displayed in a structured format.
- **Error Handling**: Proper error messages are displayed if there's an issue with the image upload or data extraction.

## Components Breakdown

### 1. `ImageUploadBox.jsx`
Handles the image upload for both the front and back sides of the Aadhaar card. It shows the upload button, previews the uploaded image, and provides a reset option.

### 2. `ErrorDisplay.jsx`
A small component for displaying error messages in case of invalid file uploads or failed data extraction.

### 3. `ExtractedDataDisplay.jsx`
This component is responsible for rendering the extracted Aadhaar data (name, Aadhaar number, date of birth, gender, address, etc.).

### 4. `OCRService.js`
Contains utility functions:
- **`validateFile(file)`**: Validates the uploaded file based on type and size.
- **`convertToBase64(file)`**: Converts the uploaded image file to a Base64 string for transmission to the backend API.
- **`processAadhaarOCR(frontImage, backImage)`**: Sends the front and back images to the backend OCR API for Aadhaar data extraction.

### 5. `App.jsx`
The main component orchestrating the entire app. It handles state management (images, previews, errors, loading status, and extracted data) and renders the UI by composing the smaller components (`ImageUploadBox`, `ErrorDisplay`, `ExtractedDataDisplay`).

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js** and **npm** (or **yarn**)
- A backend server running the OCR API. The frontend assumes the API is available at `http://localhost:5000/api/ocr`.

### Steps to Run

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/aadhaar-ocr.git
   cd aadhaar-ocr
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Use npm or yarn to install the required dependencies.
   ```bash
   npm install
   # OR
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Start the Development Server**:
   Run the Vite development server.
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # OR
   yarn dev
   ```

   The app will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Backend Setup

For the frontend to work properly, you need a backend server that processes the OCR. The frontend is sending a POST request to the following endpoint:
```
POST http://localhost:5000/api/ocr
```
The backend is expected to return a JSON response with the extracted Aadhaar details (name, Aadhaar number, date of birth, gender, address, etc.).

Example of the expected response format:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "name": "John Doe",
    "aadhaarNumber": "1234-5678-9012",
    "dob": "01/01/1980",
    "gender": "Male",
    "address": "123 Main Street",
    "pincode": "123456"
  }
}
```

### Environment Variables

If you need to change the backend API URL, you can configure the base API URL by setting environment variables in a `.env` file:
```env
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5000
```

### Building for Production

To create a production-ready build of the app:
```bash
npm run build
# OR
yarn build
```
This will generate the optimized files in the `/dist` directory.

## Technologies Used

- **React.js**: Frontend framework
- **Vite**: Fast build tool for frontend projects
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Core programming language
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework
- **React Icons**: For displaying icons like upload and error icons

## Future Improvements

- **Form Validation**: Add more robust form validation with custom hooks.
- **TypeScript**: Refactor to TypeScript for type safety.
- **Unit Tests**: Implement unit testing for components and services.
